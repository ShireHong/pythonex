One day someone will walk into your life, then you realize love was always worth waiting for
Some things, you know, but you don't even know that
Will we at last forget ourselves result from the continuous affectation
Real happiness, not ecstasy, also not pain, it is slow, the big wave
Don’t cry over the past, cry to get over the past. Don’t smile to hide the pain, smile to heal the pain
